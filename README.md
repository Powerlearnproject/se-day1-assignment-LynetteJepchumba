Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the process of designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software in a structured way.
It’s important because it helps create reliable and efficient software that supports businesses and tech advancements.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1950s-60s: Software Engineering Concept – The term was introduced to solve software problems.
1970s: Waterfall Model – A structured approach to software development.
2001: Agile Manifesto – Brought flexibility and collaboration to development.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning – Define what needs to be built.
Analysis – Gather requirements.
Design – Create the system structure.
Implementation – Write the actual code.
Testing – Find and fix issues.
Deployment – Release the software.
Maintenance – Keep improving and updating it.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall – Step-by-step, good for projects with fixed requirements (e.g., government systems).
Agile – Flexible, good for projects with changing needs (e.g., mobile apps).


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer – Writes code and builds the software.
QA Engineer – Tests for bugs and issues.
Project Manager – Plans and organizes the project.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs – Help with coding and debugging (e.g., VS Code, IntelliJ).
VCS – Tracks code changes and helps with teamwork (e.g., Git, GitHub).

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Tight deadlines – Break tasks into smaller parts (Agile).
Bugs & errors – Do proper testing.
Keeping up with new tech – Keep learning and practicing.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing – Tests small parts of the code.
Integration Testing – Checks if different parts work together.
System Testing – Tests the whole application.
Acceptance Testing – Makes sure it meets user needs

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the skill of creating clear and specific instructions for AI to get accurate and useful responses. 
It’s important because well-structured prompts help AI understand exactly what the user needs, leading to better answers.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt: "Tell me about farming."
Improved Prompt: "Explain the differences between organic and commercial farming, focusing on costs, productivity, and environmental impact."
It’s specific (focuses on organic vs. commercial farming).
It’s clear (asks for a comparison).
It’s concise (straight to the point but detailed).
